# Internet Topology Visualization using React and `react-vis-graph`

This project aims to create a visually appealing and informative internet topology visualization using the `react-vis-graph` package in React. The visualization showcases the route of data packets between source and destination nodes, incorporating logos for these nodes. The data is collected through various techniques and processed to create a meaningful representation.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The frontend framework for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **`react-vis-graph` Package**: Used for rendering the graph visualization of nodes and links.
- **`traceroute` Command**: Utilized to trace the route of data packets between nodes.
- **WHOIS**: Used to query IP addresses and gather information about Autonomous Systems (AS) and LAN addresses.
- **Python and Bash Scripts**: Employed for data processing, conversion, and formatting.

## Process Overview

1. **Data Collection and Route Tracing**:
   - Initially, NextTrace was used for route tracing, employing the underlying `traceroute` command.
   - Later, the direct `traceroute` command was used to gather IP addresses along the route.

2. **IP Address and AS Information**:
   - Extracted IP addresses from the traceroute results.
   - WHOIS queries were performed on these addresses to obtain AS numbers and LAN address details.

3. **Data Processing and Formatting**:
   - The traceroute data was saved to a text file, e.g., `file.txt`.
   - Python and Bash scripts were developed to process the data:
     - Data was transformed into a custom format using string manipulation.
     - The processed data was organized and structured.

4. **Visualization**:
   - The processed data was loaded into the React application.
   - The `react-vis-graph` package was employed to create an interactive graph visualization.
   - Source and destination nodes were enriched with logo images for a more informative display.

## Running the Project

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the application using `npm start`.
4. Open the web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the visualization.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the integration of various technologies to create an insightful internet topology visualization. By combining route tracing, WHOIS queries, and data processing, the project provides a comprehensive view of data packet routes and associated network information. React, and the `react-vis-graph` package enhance the visualization's interactivity and user experience.


# Key Findings

Throughout the course of this project, several significant insights have emerged that shed light on the intricate nature of the internet's topology and its underlying infrastructure:

1. **Load Balancing and Redundancy for Prominent Companies**:
   Having multiple IP addresses and AS numbers for prominent companies such as Google and Facebook is not merely coincidental. This strategy serves a crucial purpose â€“ load balancing and redundancy. By employing this approach, these tech giants can efficiently distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers. This proactive distribution prevents the undue burdening of a single server, enhancing performance and fortifying fault tolerance mechanisms. This practice ensures smoother user experiences and better service availability, even during unexpected disruptions.

2. **Core Nodes and Network Hierarchy**:
   The visual representation of our graph distinctly showcases the hierarchical structure of the internet's network topology. Core nodes, comprising ISPs (Internet Service Providers) and IXPs (Internet Exchange Points), are marked by their high degree and numerous connections. In stark contrast, peripheral nodes, representing destinations such as end-users or specific services, exhibit fewer connections. This hierarchical arrangement reflects the internet's organization, where central hubs play a pivotal role in routing data, while peripheral nodes contribute to diversity and reach.

3. **Understanding the Network Landscape**:
   The visualization effectively captures the interplay between core nodes with multiple connections and peripheral nodes with fewer connections. This distinction in connectivity underscores the core nodes' significance in directing traffic and maintaining the internet's overall functionality. Appreciating this distribution of connections is essential to comprehend information flow and the collaboration of nodes for seamless data transmission.

4. **Advantages of Single IP and AS Configuration** :
   Our analysis revealed instances where certain destinations, like "arcesium," possess a single IP address and a single AS number. This streamlined configuration offers several advantages:
   - **Simplicity and Predictability**: The straightforward structure reduces complexity in management.
   - **Efficient Routing**: Singular paths optimize routing and minimize latency.
   - **Ease of Troubleshooting**: Isolating issues becomes simpler, aiding troubleshooting.
   - **Clear Ownership**: Ownership and responsibility for a specific IP and AS are clear, facilitating accountability.

   This insight highlights how intentional design choices can yield substantial benefits in network management and operation.

5. **Decentralization and Resilience**:
   The decentralized nature of the internet, along with its redundant connections, contributes to its resilience. Even if certain nodes or links fail, the network can often reroute traffic through alternative paths.
